- **Market:** College students/young adults living in apartments with more than 1 person. 1/3 of Americans have roommates.
- **Habit:** Daily check-ins for notifications (items added to wishlist, chore updates, etc)
- **Scope:** V1 would allow rent notifications, incoming guest notifications, chores to-do list, and splitting costs. V2 will charge users to a “virtual wallet” that will order the items on Amazon.
